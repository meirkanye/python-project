## Overview

The code consists of a FastAPI application with three main functionalities:

1. **View Menu (`/menu`):** Retrieve the list of available items on the coffee shop menu.

2. **View Orders (`/order`):** Retrieve the list of placed orders.

3. **Place Order (`/order`):** Submit a new order, specifying the item ID and quantity.

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn
    ```

2. Run the application:

    ```bash
    uvicorn your_file_name:app --reload
    ```

Replace `your_file_name` with the name of the file where your FastAPI app is defined.

## Usage

- Access the [Swagger Documentation](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) for detailed information about available endpoints and interact with the API.

- Use [ReDoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc) for an alternative documentation view.
